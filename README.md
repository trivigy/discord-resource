# Discord notification resource

Sends messages to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) channels.

> Please note that I do not have automated deployment to docker hub yet and 
will set it up in the future. For now I do it regularly when I update the repo.

## Resource Type Configuration

```yaml
resource_types:
- name: discord-resource
  type: docker-image
  source:
    repository: trivigy/discord-resource
```

## Resource Configuration Example
```yaml
resources:
- name: discord
  type: discord-resource
  check_every: 999999h
  source:
    token: ((token))
```

## Behavior

### `check`: Not implemented.

### `in`: Not implemented.

### `out`: Send message to a Discord channel.

Send message to a discord channel with the configured parameters. Parameters can be passed in using the [params](https://concourse-ci.org/jobs.html#schema.step.put-step.params) key on the `put` step or passed in via files.

#### Parameters: `params`

**One of either the `_file` or non-`_file` parameters are required.**

The `_file` parameters take precedence over whatever is set in the `params` key of the `put` step.

- `channel` (_string_): Specifies which channel to post the message in. The bot must have permissions authorized to send_messages for the specific channel. The channel ID is a number that should be provided in quotes.
- `channel_file` (_string_): Specifies which channel to post the message in. The bot must have permissions authorized to send_messages for the specific channel. The channel ID is a number. It does not need to be wrapped in quotes within the text file.
- `title` (_string)_: Any text wanted to ultimately appear on the page as the title of the message.
- `title_file` (_string_): Path to file containing the text wanted to ultimately appear on the page as the title of the message.
- `message` (_string_): The text that will be inside the body of the message.
- `message_file` (_string_): Path to file containing the text that will be inside the body of the message.
- `color` (_string_): A hex color code. This will be the background color of the message when posted to Discord. Defaults to black if omitted.

## Usage Examples
```yaml
jobs:
- name: discord-send
  plan:
  - put: discord
    params:
      channel: "((channel_id))"
      color: "5CB85C"
      title: Hello World!
      message: |
        Success
```

Using the `_file` params. There's a `task` step before the `put` which generates the `discord-message` output.

```yaml
jobs:
- name: discord-send
  plan:
  - task: generate-discord-message
    file: tasks/generate-discord-message.sh
  - put: discord
    params:
      channel_file: "discord-message/channel"
      title_file: "discord-message/title"
      message_file: "discord-message/message"
```
